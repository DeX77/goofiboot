* add option for loader.conf to lock down
    menu, (e)dit, (d)efault, (*)dump ?

* postinst
  - never touch *any* unrelated fragment file from a specific kernel install;
    (do not try to be smart)
  - avoid suggesting to install non-admin files in /etc (/etc/kernel/post...)

* add "title-detail" (carrying the machine id or the device name) support to
  the fragment file and display the details along with the "title" if we have
  non-unique titles (pretty looking menu without silly numbers if no needed)

* properly document the config file format, directory layout and EFI variable
  in the wiki; make it more look like a spec
