* add option for loader.conf to lock down: menu, (e)dit, (d)efault, (*)dump ?
  --> silly "protection" against init=/bin/sh and the visibility of passwords

* postinst: never touch *any* unrelated fragment file, only the one for the
  specific kernel install/removal -> do not try to be smart

* avoid to suggest to install non-admin files in /etc (/etc/kernel/post...)
  -> it's 2012, /etc is not for static stuff, it's *local* admin territory

* add "title-detail" (carrying the machine-id / the root device name) support
  to the fragment file. Display the details along with the "title" if we have
  non-unique titles -> pretty looking menu without silly numbers if not needed

* properly document the config file format, directory layout and EFI variable
  in the wiki; make it more look like a spec -> easier to adapt other loaders
